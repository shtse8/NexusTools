# Progress: NexusTools Core Toolkit MCP Server (v0.1.0 - Refactor In Progress)

## 1. What Works (Post-Initial Refactor)

- **Project Renaming:** Project structure, configuration (`package.json`), and
  core code (`src/index.ts`) updated to use the "NexusTools" name and version
  `0.1.0`.
- **Git Remote:** Old `origin` remote removed.
- **Core Toolset Structure:**
  - Handler files for removed tools (`chmod`, `chown`) deleted.
  - Handler index (`src/handlers/index.ts`) updated.
  - `read_content` handler modified to include schema and basic logic structure
    for partial reads (`start_line`/`end_line`).
- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and
  identifies itself as "NexusTools".
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests, showing the
  updated core toolset.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function (inherited) prevents path
  traversal and rejects absolute paths.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Inherited basic error handling (e.g., `ENOENT`)
  remains functional.
- **Documentation (Initial Update):**
  - `README.md` rewritten for NexusTools.
  - Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`,
    `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) updated to
    reflect the new project identity and scope.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Verify `read_content` Partial Read Logic:** Thoroughly test the
  implementation of partial reads, including edge cases (start/end out of
  bounds, start > end, single line files, empty files).
- **Review `list_files`:** (Done) Confirmed working correctly after path
  resolution fix. No simplification needed currently.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Test all core NexusTools functionalities:
  - Batch operations for tools that support them.
  - Edge cases (empty arrays, special characters, permissions errors, large
    numbers of items).
  - Cross-device operations for `move_items` and `copy_items` (potential `EXDEV`
    errors).
- **Update CI/CD:** Modify `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to use the new
  package name (`@shtse8/nexus-tools`) and Docker Hub repository name
  (`shtse8/nexus-tools`).
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining debugging logs or unused code
  fragments.
- **Commit Changes:** Stage and commit all refactoring changes locally.
- **New Repository Setup (Optional):** Create a new remote repository and push
  the code.

## 3. Current Status

- **Refactoring In Progress:** The initial code and documentation updates for
  the NexusTools identity and core toolset are complete.
- **Builds Successfully:** The project should build successfully after
  `npm install`.
- **Core Functionality Partially Tested:** Basic server startup and tool listing
  work. Individual tool functionality, especially the modified `read_content`,
  requires testing.
- **Deployment Not Configured:** CI/CD workflow needs updating for the new
  names.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **`read_content` Partial Read:** Needs thorough testing.
- **`list_files` Complexity/Reliability:** (Resolved) Tool confirmed working
  correctly in all modes after path resolution fix.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`); needs testing.
